# Cortico-Basal Ganglia Visual Change Detection: Project Overview

## Preface
This project investigates neural dynamics in the medial striatum of mice performing a visual change-detection task. The experiment combines Neuropixels recordings, optogenetic tagging, and behavioral monitoring to study how striatal circuits support learning and action selection.

## Experimental Setup
- **Subjects:** Chr2-Cre mice injected with AAV2/1-Cre in secondary motor cortex (anterior/posterior).
- **Optogenetics:** Two optic fibers (SNr & GPe) for stimulation and antidromic tagging.
- **Task:** Mice perform a visual change-detection task:
  - **Trial Structure:**  
    - Inter-trial interval (gray screen)
    - Baseline (drifting grating, 1 Hz, noisy)
    - Speed change (to 1.25, 1.35, 1.5, 2, or 4 Hz) after â‰¥6s
    - Mouse must lick within 2.15s of change for reward
    - Outcomes: Hit, Miss, False Alarm (FA), Abort
- **Recording:**  
  - Neuropixels 2.0 4-shank probes (chronic)
  - Video (face, pupil, body)
  - Behavioral sensors (wheel, lick spout)
- **Optotagging Protocol:**  
  - 500 blue light pulses (10 ms each) delivered post-session to identify striatal cell types via antidromic activation.

## Data Acquisition & Storage
- **Raw Data:**  
  - Neural: `.bin` files, spike times, clusters, templates
  - Behavioral: trial logs, outcomes, reaction times
  - Video: synchronized camera streams
  - Session metadata: settings, parameters

- **Example Data Structure:**  
  - `NPX_probes`: neural data (channels, spike times, clusters, waveforms)
  - `NI_events`: event timings (stimulus, licks, valves, etc.)
  - `behav_data`: trial-by-trial info (stimulus, outcome, reaction time)
  - `SessionSettings` & `ComputerSettings`: experiment/session metadata

## Research Questions

### Technical
- Are striatal cells properly optotagged? Can we classify DI/D2 SPNs?
- Can waveform properties be used to define cell types if optotagging is inefficient?
- Can units be reliably tracked across days/training?

### Biological
- How do single neurons respond to different trial outcomes?
- Can neurons be grouped by response patterns?
- What does population activity look like across trials and learning?
- How do mice learn to balance impulsive actions and stimulus sensitivity?
- How is expert performance represented in neural activity?
